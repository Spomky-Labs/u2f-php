Webauthn (FIDO2)
================

With this library, you can add multi-factor authentication like FIDO UF does or add passwordless authentication support for your application using the new FIDO2 Webauthn specification.

There are two steps to perform:

* [Associate the device to your user (Public Key Credential Creation)](PublicKeyCredentialCreation.md)
* [Check authentication request (Public Key Credential Request)](PublicKeyCredentialRequest.md)
