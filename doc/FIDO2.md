Webauthn (FIDO2)
================

With this library, you can add passwordless authentication support for your application using the FIDO2 Webauthn specification.

Like the FIDO U2F protocol, there are two steps to perform:

* [Associate the device to your user (Public Key Credential Creation)](PublicKeyCredentialCreation.md)
* [Check authentication request (Public Key Credential Request)](PublicKeyCredentialRequest.md)
